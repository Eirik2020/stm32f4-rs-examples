# Introduction
Learning embedded rust has been quite the frustrating experiance for me, a lot of outdated documentation. Therefor, I intend to expand that pile!

This is a guide on how to do embedded rust on the NUCLEO-F401RE, using embedded HAL and defmt. If you are using a different microcontroller or debugger, you are out of luck, sorry not sorry!

The book is broken up into a set-up, some examples of common tasks and hopefully some deep-dives in the future!.
