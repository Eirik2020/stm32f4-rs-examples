# Examples
Here is a list of examples to show how to do most basic stuff in embedded rust, like:
1. Sending serial messages to your PC
2. How to turn on or off a LED with a GPIO pin
3. How to read the value of a button with a GPIO pin
4. How to do pulse-width-modulation (PWM)
5. How to read analog voltages from a potentiometer  


These examples are available on my Github Repo, `stm32f4-rs-examples`, and can be cloned with:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Eirik2020/stm32f4-rs-examples.git
```

Then opened with:
```sh
code stm32f4-rs-examples
```
