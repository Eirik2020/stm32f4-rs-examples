# Examples
Here is a list of examples to show how to do most basic stuff in embedded rust.

These examples are available on my Github Repo, `stm32f4-rs-examples`, and can be cloned with:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Eirik2020/stm32f4-rs-examples.git
```

Then opened with:
```sh
code stm32f4-rs-examples
```
